"""Shot extraction + xG/xA scoring, routed through the shared models.

xG: the v3 artifact in <repo root>/xg_core_v3 (23 features — the base-14 geometry plus
9 shot-/assist-context extras; LR + monotone-GBM + market blend, isotonic map; trained
on La Liga + EPL 4 seasons each + the World Cup). FIVE of the extras come from the
shot's ASSISTING PASS, so xG must be scored with the whole match's events in hand: call
match_xg_map(match_data) ONCE per match, then look each shot's xG up via
shot_xg(ev, xg_by_event). There is deliberately no per-shot scalar path in this module —
scoring a shot in isolation would silently zero the 9 extras and return degraded xG.

xA: unchanged code — the pass-level xA artifact in <repo root>/xg_core (P(pass becomes
an assist), two-stage + isotonic). Only the trained file improved, so it is a drop-in.

Scoring is pure python (stdlib); if lightgbm is installed the scorers silently upgrade
to the full blends — both paths are calibrated. renderer.build_shot_df routes xG through
the same v3 scorer, so the site and the PNGs still agree. Retrain xG with the XG V3
trainer; xA with xg_core/train_xa.py.
